# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, where multiple independent variables are used to predict the dependent variable. Scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python, can be used to implement multiple linear regression models and to read, preprocess, and split data.
